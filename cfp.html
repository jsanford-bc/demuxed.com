      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>
        After hosting a meetup for over a year and a half, we’ve become what is universally agreed on as the greatest
        ensemble of video engineers the world has ever known. That may be a tiny bit of hyperbole: but in all seriousness, we
        really have built a great group of engineers and we think it’s time for more people to join.
      </p>

      <p>
        In an effort to grow our humble video engineering community, we’ve decided to put on a conference. There are events out
        there for content producers and distributors, but none of them have a singular focus on the underlying technology and what
        goes into building it. We’re looking for speakers with experience from across the internet video spectrum, from building a
        player to writing specs, to encoding, and everything in between those things. Basically, if you’re an engineer with
        experience working on video, you belong. We’re looking for talks that fit anywhere in the engineer-building-internet-video
        spectrum, but some potentially interesting topics include:

        <ul>
          <li>New formats</li>
          <li>Encoding / Decoding</li>
          <li>Player technology</li>
          <li>Delivery</li>
          <li>Color space theory</li>
          <li>Tooling</li>
          <li>Accessibility</li>
          <li>Whatever else you think might be cool. Srsly.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We're accepting 3 "kinds" of talks: Lightning (3 minutes), 25 minutes, or 45 minutes. Lightning talks are going to be one after
        the other and with pretty strict time restraints, so these need to be rapid fire! Keep in mind that the 25 and
        45 minute time slots include time for questions and answers, so be sure to take that into account when planning.

      <h3>Who's behind this?</h3>
      <p>
        This all started at the SF Video Technology meetup (we're clearly geniuses when it comes to naming) in 2013. Over time,
        the group grew to have engineers from some of the top video companies in the Bay Area, including
        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/71mqpikjz0hz04m/Silicon%20Valley%20SF%20Video%20Reference.mov?dl=0" parent="_blank">Pied Piper</a>.
        A number of those engineers started thinking about doing something bigger, and that's how VidTechCon was born!
      </p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        These engineers are also helping to organize this conference by submitting talks, vetting submissions (that aren't their own, of course), and
        even hosting the entire event (thanks again, <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com" parent="_blank">Crunchyroll</a>).

      <h3>Not sure? Need help picking a topic?</h3>
      <p>
        We’re happy to help! If you work in video but you’re not sure what to talk about, please reach out. We can help flesh out
        vague ideas or convince you that we desperately need you on stage talking about how you got a Babbage Analytical Engine to encode
        VP9. Basically if you have the tiniest desire to talk and you have any concerns at all, shoot us an email: <a href="mailto:sfvidtech@gmail.com">sfvidtech@gmail.com</a>.
        (just don’t use this to submit a proposal, use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uf-1Herigb9vDIo1_U0yvt0ExYYQYMa7BZHikF9kwtw/viewform?usp=send_form">form</a>).

        Because this is a single track conference, we have to be pretty selective with our topics. As such, we will only be able to accept
        a small number of the talk submissions we receive. We will provide the following:

        <ul>
          <li>Free Admission</li>
          <li>Some kind of sweet speaker-specific swag</li>
          <li>Time on stage in front of the video engineering illuminati</li>
